# SEM_scale_bar
Software for fast processing of images obtained from scanning electron microscope (SEM). The software cuts an info-panel from the image and creates a scale bar according to the image's metadata. The current version (v3) works with SEM images (only 'tif' extension)  obtained from Tescan and Zeiss microscopes.
